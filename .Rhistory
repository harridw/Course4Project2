#
#  Review Criteria
#    For each question
#    1. Does the plot appear to address the question being asked?
#    2. Is the submitted R code appropriate for construction of the submitted plot?
#
#  Assignment
#  The overall goal of this assignment is to explore the National Emissions Inventory database and

#  period 1999–2008. You may use any R package you want to support your analysis.
#
#  Questions
#  You must address the following questions and tasks in your exploratory analysis. For each

#  3. Of four types of sources indicated by 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable
#     which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore
#     City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008? Use the ggplot2 plotting system to
#     make a plot answer this question.
#  4. Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed

#  Coursera: Data Science Specialization: Course 4 - Exploratory Data Analysis
#  Peer-graded Assignment:  Course 4 Project 2  [Course4Project2]
#
#  Assignment Requirements / Guidelines:
#  Source data is text file 'household_power_consumption.txt' in working directory
#
#  NOTE: (per instructions in section 'Loading the data')
#  We will only be using data from the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02. One alternative is to read
#  the data from just those dates rather than reading in the entire dataset and subsetting to those
#  dates.
#
#  Review Criteria
#    For each question
#    1. Does the plot appear to address the question being asked?
#    2. Is the submitted R code appropriate for construction of the submitted plot?
#
#  Assignment
#  The overall goal of this assignment is to explore the National Emissions Inventory database and
#  see what it say about fine particulate matter pollution in the United states over the 10-year
#  period 1999–2008. You may use any R package you want to support your analysis.
#
#  Questions
#  You must address the following questions and tasks in your exploratory analysis. For each
#  question/task you will need to make a single plot. Unless specified, you can use any plotting
#  system in R to make your plot.
#
#  1. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? Using the
#     base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each
#     of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.
#  2. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (fips == "24510")
#     from 1999 to 2008? Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.
#  3. Of four types of sources indicated by 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable
#     which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore
#     City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008? Use the ggplot2 plotting system to
#     make a plot answer this question.
#  4. Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed
#     from 1999–2008?
#  5. How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 in Baltimore City?
#  6. Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor
#     vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (𝚏𝚒𝚙𝚜 == "𝟶𝟼𝟶𝟹𝟽"). Which city
#     has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?

#  QUESTION 6: Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor
#     vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (𝚏𝚒𝚙𝚜 == "𝟶𝟼𝟶𝟹𝟽"). Which city
#     has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?
